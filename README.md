# FiNDAPI

FiNDAPI is a API developed with the intention of being able to succesfully parse any scientific paper in a majority of the most common formats.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install Python 3.6.5 if you do not have it. The download can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing

Run the setup.py to install all the needed dependencies. It is best to do this in a virtual enviorment if possible.

```
python setup.py install
```

To start the server run the following commands:

```
cd FiNDAPI
python app.py
```
The server should now be running. Go to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to view the Swagger Documentation for use of the API.
